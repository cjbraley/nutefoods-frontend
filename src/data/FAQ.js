        title: "Are your products vegan?",
        body: "No, but they are all vegetarian. We believe a more plant-based diet benefits your health and rejuvenates our Earth.",

      {
        title: "What diet do yoü believe in?",
        body: "We believe in balance. Eat natural, and eat varied. We do not recommend a completely vegan diet, as this approach makes it difficult to obtain the nütrition yoü need to thrive. Understand what yoür body needs and nourish it conscientiously. Know what yoü eat, how much, and where it comes from - this approach really does not need to detriment our beloved planet.",

        title: "What is Earth-friendly to yoü?",
        body: "We agree with the philosopher Alan Watts: “the world beyond the skins is an extension of our own bodies.”<br><br>We feel personal with natüre, so we are very conscious of how our decisions can impact her. We try to help everybody invigorate their connection to natüre, but we don’t demand enormous sacrifices and we don’t believe in inducing guilt. We appreciate that all of us face real constraints on our ability to make the most sustainable choices. Our role is to diminish those constraints; to make your choices easier and better informed.<br><br>Every caring act stems from a relationship, and we want to nurture your relationship with our planet.",

        title: "How to recycle your packaging?",
        body: "Yes, yoü absolutely can. The products are 100% circular, but only with your help:<br><br><strong>Icebar Smoothie</strong><br><br><i>Bar and package wrapping</i> - Please kindly return to us clean on your next delivery, and we will help yoü recycle.<br><br><i>Individual box</i> - Recycle in the paper section.",
      },
      {
        title: "How else are yoü helping the Earth?",
        body: "<strong>Sourcing</strong> - All our fresh fruits and vegetables come from local markets. For the rest (nuts, seeds, grains, and less conventional ingredients), we first try to source from zero-packaging suppliers, but if this significantly harms the product’s affordability, then we compromise by purchasing from suppliers who not only provide quality ingredients, but also contribute towards environmental and / or community sustainability. We recycle as much of the packaging as possible, through both government and private recycling organisations - we will update yoü with statistical figures when we are a few months into business.<br><br><strong>Packaging</strong> - There is a lot of goodness in our products, all of which comes with <strong>zero plastic</strong>. So long as we have your help, all of it is recyclable, too.<br><br><strong>Delivery</strong> - We are making the deliveries ourselves twice per week, grouping orders together to minimise transportation, and eliminating the packaging materials which outsourced couriers would otherwise use. Of course, this should guarantee to keep our frozen products in top condition throughout transit.<br><br><strong>Carbon offset</strong> - We recognise that some of our activities - purchasing overseas ingredients, delivering our products to yoü - contribute to the carbon emissions harming our Earth. To be honest, we do not yet know how much emissions we will be producing every year, but we are starting the offset by contributing to <i>Mangrove Action Project</i>, a global mangrove conservation and restoration organisation based in Seattle. We begin our commitment by contributing 2% of our profits to this cause, and we will scale up our efforts as we grow.",

      {
        title: "Why does science matter?",
        body: "Intrinsically, it never takes any sides, it can logically explain what works, and it encourages its theories to be tested by controlled trials and experiments. Science really is our most reliable and trustworthy friend.",
      },
      {
        title: "How are your products fünctional?",
        body: "We want to make yoü feel good through food. We believe that our best chance of doing so is by delving into a wide range of scientific research to find the information that best helps us match specific combinations of food with specific functions for your health. This is - and will always be - our approach to our creations. Of course, we do our best to make them tasty, too.",

      },
      {
        title: "Where are your ingredients from?",
        body: "We source as many of our ingredients as possible from local markets. For the less conventional ingredients, we do a great amount of due diligence to identify the overseas suppliers whose work best produces not only quality ingredients, but also positive outcomes for their communities and our Earth.",
      },
      {
        title: "How and where do yoü make them?",
        body: "We use vacuum blenders to blend the ingredients, minimising micronutrient loss through air. Once blended, we immediately freeze these nutritious fusions.<br><br>All this magic happens in a licensed food factory in Hong Kong.",
      },
      {
        title: "How should I consume them?",
        body: "We recommend that yoü blend/ let it melt with your liquid of choice, or just dive right into it as it is (though it’s probably wise to let it lose its chill a little, if taken straight out of the freezer). Yoü can even chop them up into cubes and mix them with fruits or breakfast bowls - feel free to get creative with them.",

        title: "How should I store them?",

      {
        title: "How long can I keep them for?",

      },
      {
        title: "Are they meal replacements?",
        body: "We don’t like this term very much, because it makes our foods seem artificial, when they are actually just combinations of real, fresh foods.<br><br>But in terms of calories and macronutrients, we would say that energy and recovery can serve as a light breakfast, or even a hearty one, if yoü use two bars to make one large smoothie. Detox and immunity are more refreshments - at any time of the day - to nourish you with a plethora of antioxidants and micronutrients.",
      },

        title: "Do they contain allergens?",
        body: "Some of them, yes. Please carefully read through the statements below if yoü have concerns.<br><br><strong>Detox</strong> - none.<br><strong>Energy</strong> - contains peanuts and tree nuts. May contain traces of gluten.<br><strong>Immunity</strong> - contains tree nuts.<br><strong>Recovery</strong> - contains tree nuts.

        title: "Are these compatible with paleo/ keto diets?",
        body: "Most of our products are suitable for a paleo diet. We use real ingredients that are natural and minimally-processed, guaranteeing you a freshly-made product with the absence of refined sugars and dairy. However, we do include gluten-free whole grains in some of our products to cater for those that are intolerant or allergic to gluten.<br><br>On the other hand, our products may not be suitable for those on ketogenic diets, which have a high fat requirement and strict limits on the intake of carbohydrates. Plenty of our ingredients (fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains) are sources of complex carbohydrates that come with natural sugars, but also a wealth of macro- and micronutrients.",
