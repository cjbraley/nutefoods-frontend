                        We work hard to ensure the security and integrity of our website. On a
                        regular basis, we scan our website for security gaps and known
                        vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to our site as safe as possible.

                        obligations under applicable privacy laws. In keeping with industry
                        guidelines, we will promptly make recommended steps to notify you of the
                        breach.

                        personal information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does
                        not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in
                        operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so
                        long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may

                        we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about
                        these sites.

                    <p>
                        We retain your personal information only as long as necessary to accomplish
                        the business purpose for which it was collected, or to comply with our legal
                        and contractual obligations. Afterwards, we will securely dispose such
                        personal information, as required by applicable law.
