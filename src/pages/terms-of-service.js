                        We only deliver to addresses within Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, excluding
                        New Territories, outlying islands or any PO Boxes. We keep delivery
                        logistics in-house to ensure the quality and integrity of our products, as
                        well as to minimise packaging material used in this process. <br />
                        <br />
                        Deliveries are free for any orders at or above HKD 600 before any
                        discount(s), otherwise we charge a flat one-time fee of HKD 40 per order.
                        Any redeliveries will also be charged a flat one-time fee of HKD 40 per
                        order.

                        <br />
                        We provide you with delivery time options when you order on our Website. Any
                        order that contains frozen products will require pick-up in person. For such
                        order, after your order is confirmed, we will contact you a day before your
                        preferred delivery date to obtain your acknowledgement and agreement for us
                        to deliver your order at an agreed time the following day. We will only
                        proceed with delivery after we obtain such acknowledgement and agreement
                        from you. For any order that contains only shelf-stable products, we will
                        deliver on your preferred delivery date without contacting you in advance.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        If your order contains frozen products and no one is present to receive your
                        order at the agreed time, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to
                        contact you to reschedule delivery (in which case our standard redelivery
                        fee of HKD 40 shall apply), and we also reserve the right to cancel your
                        order at our sole discretion, in which case we will not issue any credit or
                        refund to you for the total price of your order (including any delivery
                        fees). If another person is receiving your order on your behalf, please
                        provide us with specific instructions at least 12 hours before the agreed
                        delivery time.

                        they are carefully handled to stay frozen at the time of delivery, but you
                        are solely responsible for confirming that these products you receive are

                        label instructions. From the time of receipt, the condition and consumption
